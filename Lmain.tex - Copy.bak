\abstract{%
    The recent breakthroughs in the production of multicore processors which are broadly available in terms of price and usability to a wide range of consumers have brought the importance of concurrency into the spotlight. 
Concurrency is now ubiquitous and several challenges have arisen due to the extensive use of it. The most important challenge is the writing of programs that make use of concurrency in an efficient way, under the provision that their outcome will always be as expected. To ensure the seamless operation of concurrent programs, they should be tested thoroughly making all the possible assumptions / test cases about the input and trying to predict that the outcome will meet our expectations. 
The coding of concurrent programming is more error prone in comparison with sequential programming, since it is often more complex and the memory space is shared among the different threads. To prevent an unexpected output of our program we should perform a code analysis. Code analysis can be done either manually or with some code analysis tools. Manual code analysis is difficult and very time consuming for big programs and thus code analysis tools should be preferred. 
Code analysis tools are divided into two categories, static analysis tools and dynamic analysis tools. The advantages and disadvantages of each category will be presented, as well as the reasons for assessing only certain static analysis tools. 
These tools will be used to review the source code of open source programs and their efficiency in finding bugs will be assessed. The present thesis is going to evaluate these programs only from the perspective of finding bugs in the context of concurrency in Java.
In a nutshell, this project is about assessing tools for finding concurrency bugs in Java.

%% Acknowledgements
\begin{acknowledgements}
This thesis signifies the completion of my MSc studies, an important step in both my academic career and my life in general. In these few lines, I would like to express my gratitude towards the people that helped me during the course of the programme.
I would like to thank professor Don Sannella first, who offered me the opportunity to work on a very interesting problem that addresses modern, real life problems and shared his knowledge whenever needed. Without his help and guidance this dissertation could not have reached its current form.
Last, but definitely not least, I would like to offer thanks my family: to my parents, Aleksandros and Chara, my brother, Stavros and to my partner, Eleni. Their complete and unconditional support and love is giving me the strength and motivation to strive to become a better person every day.

    Thank you.
