\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}
In this chapter we will present the procedure that we follow in order to conduct our experiments. Subsequently, we will present our findings and highlight the main differences that we have found. Also, it will be described  the environment and the DBMSs that we have tested.  

\section{Experimental Set Up}
We conduct all the experiments on Windows 8 with i7 CPU, 12GB Ram and solid state disk. Also, we install the mainstream DBMSs such as MySQL, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL and Oracle Database

\section{Experiment Results}
In this section we present our findings by illustrates the differences that we have detected and give an explanation about those differences

Mysql and IBM DB2 work properly if there are arithmetic calculations in the where clause such as 1*1. Even though expressions in the where clause should be evaluated to true or false, these two DBMSs convert the arithmetic expression to boolean type. Nevertheless, the rest three DBMSs do not do that, as a result, they throw an exception while they executing the query.

DBMSs evaluate each expression in the where clause to a boolean type. Thus, instead of having an expression, it can be specified the true/false keyword which is a boolean type. Nevertheless, not all the DBMSs support this. MS server and Oracle do not support this keyword.
